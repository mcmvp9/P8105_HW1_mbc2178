## Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

``` r
# The penguins dataset is printed below and consists of the following varies including species, island, bill length etc...

head(penguins, 5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 × 8

    ## # … with abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm, ²​body_mass_g

There are 344 observations (rows) and 8 variables (columns).

The mean flipper length in the `penguins` dataset is 201 measured in
millimeters (mm).

## Scatter Plot of Flipper Length vs Bill Length by Species

Next, we made a scatter plot of `flipper_length_mm` vs `bill_length_mm`
by penguin `species` below and saved the scatter plot to my project
directory.

``` r
plot_peng <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                                  y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
             geom_point()

ggsave("penguins.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

## Problem 2

``` r
peng_df <- tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm (10, mean = 0),
  
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  
  vec_hw = c("basketball", "handball", "streetball", "soccer","netball", 
              "dodgeball","football","kickball","softball","pongball"), 
  
 vec_factor_hw = factor(c("MARRIED","WIDOWED","SINGLE","MARRIED","SINGLE","WIDOWED","SINGLE","SINGLE","WIDOWED"
                            ,"MARRIED"),levels = c("MARRIED", "WIDOWED", "SINGLE"))
)
```

The mean of variable `norm_samp` is 0.2929086.

The mean of `norm_samp_pos` is 0.5.

The mean of `vec_hw` is NA.

The mean of `vec_factor_hw` is NA

I noticed that trying to take the mean of the variables `vec_hw` and
`vec_factor_hw` in the `peng_df` dataset yielded invalid results. In
short, R couldn’t perform the operation because the argument was not
numeric or logical.

Nevertheless,I was able to calculate the mean of variable `norm_samp`
and `norm_samp_pos` in this dataset.

Moving on, now let’s apply the `as.numeric` function to our logical
variable `norm_samp_pos`, character variable `vec_hw`, and factor
variable `vec_factor_hw`.

``` r
  mean(as.numeric(pull(peng_df, norm_samp_pos)))
  mean(as.numeric(pull(peng_df, vec_hw)))
  mean(as.numeric(pull(peng_df, vec_factor_hw)))
```

After applying the `as.numeric` function to the logical, character, and
factor variables, I noticed that I still received a mean value for my
logical variable and factor variable. This was because R treated the
“TRUE” and “FALSE” in my logical variable as 1 and 0 respectively.

In my factor variable, R also treated the three levels (MARRIED, SINGLE
and WIDOWED) as numeric when this function was applied. Therefore, each
factor level was given numeric codes corresponding to the alphabetical
order in the vector.

For the vector character variable, when R tried to convert it to numeric
it couldn’t and therefore returned “NA”.

This helps to explain why we couldn’t take the mean of the character and
factor variable in the first code we ran earlier.
